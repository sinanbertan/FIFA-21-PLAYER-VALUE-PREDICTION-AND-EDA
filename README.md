# FIFA 21 PLAYER VALUE PREDICTION AND EDA
- This project focuses on prediction players' market values in FIFA 21. The project includes machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset and understand its patterns. The project uses the players_21.csv dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-complete-player-dataset

## Conclusion 

* In this project, I aimed to predict the value of FIFA 21 players based on various features such as their age, overall rating, potential, and performance attributes. My predictive model achieved an impressive R2 score of 0.89, indicating that approximately 89% of the variance in the players' values can be explained by my model.
